# ADO to Jira Makeover - Chrome Extension

So your team is stuck in ADO huh
Well have no fear, Jira is here!..... kinda.

While I don't plan to script you out of ADO and into Jira (as there are plenty of other competent tools for that), I can at least make it *look like* you're in Jira so that when the time arrives for you to give Atlassian your development soul, it'll feel like home.

## Technical Details

I'm leveraging the ability that Chrome has to inject CSS onto the active tab that matches a URL starting with <https://dev.azure.com>. This is a phenomenal exercise in CSS

If you wish to download the repo instead of installing the official extension from the store, you can follow the office instructions here: <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked>
